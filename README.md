The Wyze Rule dataset provides an unprecedented real-world resource for smart home automation research. Developed by Wyze Labs, it contains over 1 million automation rules created by 300,000 users for managing 1.5+ million connected smart home devices. This extensive dataset enables the development of machine learning models for personalized rule recommendations aligned with each user’s unique devices and behaviors. The dataset includes two components:

rule dataset: Details each automation rule set by users, including trigger conditions and resulting actions.
device dataset: Maps users to all their connected smart home devices, including those not yet incorporated into a rule.
Together, these rich sources of real usage data can be leveraged to train predictive models that recommend new automation rules tailored to users’ specific needs and homes. The goal is to progress research towards smarter, more autonomous smart home management.
